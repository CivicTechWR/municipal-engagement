# Municipal Engagement Project

Some municipalities in Waterloo Region have initiatives to increase public engagement. However, public engagement remains low. Can we help increase engagement? Here are some of the questions we would like to answer. 

- What is being published? By whom? In what formats?
- What kinds of data is not being published that regular citizens might find useful?
- How can municipal data be repackaged so that regular citizens will see it?
- What strategies are effective in growing municipal engagement?

This project is published with Github Pages on the [Civic Tech WR site](https://civictechwr.org/municipal-engagement/).
