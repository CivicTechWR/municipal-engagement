Municipal Engagement Resources
==============================

Overall
-------

It looks like many of the municipalities are using the same CMS?
  + But not City of Waterloo? It looks similar but has slightly
  different URLs.

They all have "subscribe to this page" functionality. 

They all have calendars. Most of the calendars seem to have agendas
and minutes. You can subscribe to the calendars but you cannot get
useful (eg iCal) feeds directly.

Some of them have RSS feeds, but the feeds seem useless. 


Areas to Investigate
--------------------

- Zoning variances: are these published?
- Minutes and Agendas: can these be searched easily for residents
  looking for discussion of particular issues?
- Leisure activities: Apparently the current website is not user
  friendly. Can we improve this?

Webcasts
--------

- Region of Waterloo:
  <https://www.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/regional-government/live-webcast.aspx>
  + They have a calendar of upcoming webcasts, but this does not look
  machine-readable.
  + You can "subscribe to this page" and maybe get notifications about
  new things?

- Wellesley: None?

- Woolwich: None?

## Zoning

### Kitchener

- Some listings are here:
  <https://www.kitchener.ca/en/planning-and-development-consultations.aspx>

- Apparently there is an interactive map?
  <https://www.kitchener.ca/en/building-and-development/active-permits.aspx>
- There are some maps here:
  <https://map.kitchener.ca/OnPointExt/WebPages/Landing/Public.aspx>

- Kitchener is changing its zoning bylaw:
  <https://www.kitchener.ca/en/city-services/comprehensive-review-of-the-zoning-by-law-crozby.aspx>

### City of Waterloo

- <https://www.waterloo.ca/en/government/zone-changes.aspx> 

They have some information about public meetings with some (not all)
of the listings. 

(Almost all of these are zoning AWAY from agricultural land. Hmmm..)

### Wellesley

No luck yet.

### Wilmot

- <https://developmentapplications.wilmot.ca/> : Nice visualization
  and summary. Why isn't everybody doing this?
