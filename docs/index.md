Municipal Engagement Resources
==============================

Overall
-------

It looks like many of the municipalities are using the same CMS?

They all have "subscribe to this page" functionality. 

They all have calendars. Most of the calendars seem to have agendas
and minutes. You can subscribe to the calendars but you cannot get
useful (eg iCal) feeds directly.

Some of them have RSS feeds, but the feeds seem useless. 


Webcasts
--------

- Region of Waterloo:
  <https://www.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/regional-government/live-webcast.aspx>
  + They have a calendar of upcoming webcasts, but this does not look
  machine-readable.
  + You can "subscribe to this page" and maybe get notifications about
  new things?

- Wellesley: None?

- Woolwich: None?

- Wilmot: None?

- North Dumfries: None?
