Webcasts
--------

- Region of Waterloo:
  <https://www.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/regional-government/live-webcast.aspx>
  + They have a calendar of upcoming webcasts, but this does not look
  machine-readable.
  + You can "subscribe to this page" and maybe get notifications about
  new things?

Mailing Lists
-------------

- Region of Waterloo: You can subscribe to updates from many pages?
  All pages? It is not clear to me how this works.


Platforms
---------

- Region of Waterloo Engage Platform: <https://www.engagewr.ca/> .
  + You can subscribe to be informed of upcoming consultations:
    <https://www.opentownhall.com/portals/274/forum_home?phase=open>
  + It looks like there are four distinct sites for Cambridge,
    Kitchener, Waterloo and the Region?
